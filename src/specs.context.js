/**
 * Since we use webpack-specific features in our modules (e.g., loaders,
 * plugins, adding CSS to the dependency graph), we must use webpack to build a
 * test bundle.
 *
 * This module creates a context of all the unit test files (as per the unit
 * test naming convention). It's used as the webpack entry file for unit tests.
